With Isotope v2 beta out, I got a lot of stuff done this year.

_(I apologize for the braggy tone of this post. I'm lucky that this year was a good year. I'd like to capture how it happened.)_

+ [Metafizzy stickers](http://metafizzy.co/blog/sticker-give-away/)
+ [Bower logo](https://gist.github.com/desandro/1c50118441f703f3f6e1)
+ [Packery](http://packery.metafizzy.co)
+ [Draggabilly](http://draggabilly.desandro.com)
+ [imagesLoaded v3](http://desandro.github.io/imagesloaded/)
+ [Outlayer](https://github.com/metafizzy/outlayer)
+ [Masonry v3](http://masonry.desandro.com)
+ [Refactor shirt](https://cottonbureau.com/products/refactor)
+ [Bower](http://bower.io) talk
+ [Isotope v2](http://isotope.metafizzy.co)

Looking back, I'm interested how this year was more productive, considering my full-time job is appropriately demanding, and this year was the oldest I've ever been. I have several ideas why.

+ [Work](https://twitter.com) was not crazy. I was able to keep regular hours.

+ I worked on side projects in smaller time segments -- 1, 2, maybe 3 hours. I didn't stay up late into the night, tinkering. I didn't get burnt out from long work sessions. When I began a period of work, I felt capable of working for a smaller time frame and leaving things as-is when I felt I had enough.

+ My projects had clear goals. I had a decent vision of each before I began.

+ I purposely ignored the [Isotope](https://github.com/desandro/isotope/issues) and [Masonry](https://github.com/desandro/masonry/issues) issue trackers. These were inputs that didn't directly impact the projects.

+ I worked on one project at a time. I didn't start a new project until completing the current one.

I think I can generalize these reasons as comprising good balance of being _on_ and _off_. I was able to turn on and work because I was able to shut off and not work.

I find it interesting that these projects (except for the Bower talk) didn't have any hard deadlines.

Shipping Isotope v2 is a big deal for me as it is a culmination of all the projects. Every project on the list above was a necessary stepping stone towards landing the new version.

Plenty of more work is left to be addressed, but the projects are conceivably done for now. This provides a new opportunity. For the first time in years, I can focus my attention on something other than a layout library. If 2014 has any of 2013's good fortune, that may just happen.

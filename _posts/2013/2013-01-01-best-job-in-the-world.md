Last year, [my side business](http://metafizzy.co) made more money than my first job out of college.

I bring attention to this not to brag, but because it's incredible.



Making websites is the best job in the world right now.

There is so much demand, so much opportunity. I could work where ever I wanted.

So long as you have a bit of diligence, you'll make it easy.

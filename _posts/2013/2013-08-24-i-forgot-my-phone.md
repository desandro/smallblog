> I came up with the idea for this video when I was at a concert seeing my favorite DJ. The people in front of me had their phones up in the air the entire time - filming, taking pictures, posting them to Facebook and Instagram, tweeting about how cool this concert was. I saw all of this. Because it was right in front of my face. The glaring screens were right in front of my face, because I’m 5 foot 2, the perfect height for things to be right in front of my face.

> Some of you may know that this has been one of my biggest pet peeves for a long time. But you see, it’s not until very recently that I’ve discovered the joy in being in the moment - listening to people, looking at faces, expressions, details, looking at the colors of things, smelling smells, tasting food - and it’s not until now that I’ve realized that everyone - including me - is on their phones. A lot. Like, a fuck ton. And it makes me sad. I’m constantly working on living in the moment, enjoying and taking it all in (without Instagramming them - GASP!) but I know it takes a little practice. Would you maybe wanna practice with me? Even for a day. Even for an HOUR.

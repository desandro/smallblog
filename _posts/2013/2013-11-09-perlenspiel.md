Brian Moriarty, the game developer of Loom and Trinity, writes about teaching game design. For his introductory class, he develops a simplified game engine so students can hit the ground running, and immediately start developing games, instead of worrying about the game engine itself. Interesting that he choses JavaScript as the programming language for his class.

Cotton Bureau made it to one year. I love rooting for these guys. They asked me to write something nice. I wrote this:

> I love designing for web. But you can't wear it. You can't roll over on a Saturday morning to find your paramour snug in your app. You can't put on your website and feel like you look good today. Cotton Bureau allowed me to be a part of these wonderful experiences.

James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem has been working on a [system of sounds (appropriately) for the NYC Subway](http://www.subwaysymphony.org/about/).

> I love the subway system of my city--one of the most egalitarian, kind and high-functioning miracles in a city known around the world for it's nearly unforgiving toughness.  I also love sound, and music.  Unfortunately, the sound of the subway is kind of a drag.  Every time you swipe your MetroCard, the turnstile emits a flat, unpleasant "beep".  Each turnstile emits its own beep, all of which are slightly out of tune with one another, creating a dissonant rubbing-styrofoam-on-glass squeak in stations all around New York City.  It's kind of horrible.
>
> What i propose to do is to create a series of 3 to 5 note sequences, all unique, one for each station in the subway system.  These sequences will be part of an intersecting larger piece of music, which would run from station to station, and cross one another as, say, the 4, 5, 6 line (one musical piece) intersects with the L, N, R, Q and W (another musical piece) at Union Square.  At each turnstile in Union Square, as you tap your new tap and ride card, a pleasant bell tone will sound, in one of a set of possible notes, all related to that station's note sequence.  The effect would be that at the busiest times, like rush hour, what was once cacophony would now be music.

> I believe that music makes people happy, and makes them reflective.  I think people who are willing to do what it takes to live here and work here--the commutes and the crowds, deserve a small sonic gift on their way home, or to deliver something, or getting to their school in another neighborhood.  And i think that in the years to come, if this system is implemented, people who grew up with these sounds will hear a piece of music at an opera, or on an ad, or in the background of a film and feel a nostalgia for their first apartment, or their basketball practices, as they think "this song reminds me of Borough Hall" or "This song reminds me of my school be East Broadway".

This would be my favorite thing ever.

Last year, I produced a [series of halftone portraits for Electric Objects](https://www.electricobjects.com/artists/daviddesandro/artworks/JLKx). I used Creative Commons licensed photos on Flickr. I treat these photos as the raw medium, like paint on a palette. But they're of people. It's their face, front and center.

In one of their first public demos, the Electric Objects team displayed one of my portraits in a side room at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. It was just for an afternoon.

The woman from the portrait walks into that room.

She's from Brazil. I hadn't reached out to her or the photographer. She knows the [original photo](https://www.flickr.com/photos/chinaglia/5913643193) exists, but not my derivative artwork. Imagine traveling across the globe, peaking into a museum room, and seeing your own face.

It's a lovely coincidence. But I'm embarrassed. The internet doesn't have to be full of strangers. Good neighbors introduce themselves.

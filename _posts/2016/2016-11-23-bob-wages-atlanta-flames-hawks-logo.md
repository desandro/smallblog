Some long gone NHL team had lovely modern logos.

The Atlanta Flames logo lives on as the Alternate Captain letter on the Calgary Flames jersey.

The Flames logo along with the Atlanta Hawks logo (another beauty) were designed by [Bob Wages](http://www.wagesdesign.com/) for [McDonald & Little in 1972](http://www.artsatl.com/atlanta-hawks-logo/). Wages was 24.

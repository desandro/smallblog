Friends that work at Facebook: I hope you are either fighting to improve your company from the inside, or preparing to leave it.

Because Facebook has multiple figures in leadership positions that supported Trump. [Thiel vocally](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/18/donald-trump-peter-thiel-support-facebook), [Luckey surreptitiously](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/23/oculus-rift-vr-palmer-luckey-trump-shitposts?CMP=twt_gu).

Because [Zuckerberg believes the fake news his platform elevates played no part in the election](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2016/11/10/mark_zuckerberg_says_fake_news_on_facebook_had_no_impact_on_election.html).

Because [Facebook's core product promotes the distribution of false information](http://mashable.com/2016/11/09/facebook-kill-news-feed-trump/).


Because [Facebook shipped a racist feature in its core advertising product](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-lets-advertisers-exclude-users-by-race).

Your employer does not represent who you are. But you represent your company. You can stay and try to change it, or leave to signal change.

If Facebook is looking to recruit you: bring up these issues. Say no because of these issues.

> One thing I've been noticing is that throughout history communication has been getting shorter and shorter and more and more fractured. So, you start with things like letter-writing, which is very deep and slow, and then you move into phone calls and then you move into faxes and then you move into emails, then text messages. And now we're kind of hovering around tweets as the canonical form of communication right now. But it's unclear to me right now that there's another level compression after the tweet, unless we start going around and making monosyllabic grunts at each other.

> So I think we're at this interesting point where, in a way, we reached the terminal velocity of how fast our communication can go. And then, a question arises, which is: Well, do we stay there? Do we keep tweeting? Or do we somehow find an even faster way? Or do we hit some kind of wall and bounce back in the other direction, suddenly starting to crave a little bit more depth and substance again. And I am betting on that.

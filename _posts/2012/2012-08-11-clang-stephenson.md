This is a Kickstarter for a sword-fighting game, featuring Neal Stephenson, speculative fiction author and the game company's chairman. You might have seen it a month ago.

What fascinates me about this project is Stephenson's connection to it.  This idea has been in his head for a long time. His break-out book Snow Crash featured a protagonist who engaged in virtual swordplay. Now twenty years later, he's in a position where he can literally realize the fantasy.

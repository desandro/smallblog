On this day, March 21, 2012, my career officially completed a flipidee-do.

3 years ago, I worked for an IT reseller. IT resellers are the middle-men corporations that partner with manufactures like Cisco, HP, IBM/Lenovo, etc, and facilitate the purchase of stuff by customers, and the delivery of stuff by manufactures.

Yes, it was exhilarating.

Today, I received an inquiry from a reseller about re-selling [Isotope licenses](http://metafizzy.co/#isotope-license).

It is almost clich√©. Two-thirds into the movie, the protagonist finds himself in a similiar scenario that occured in the beginning -- only this time, his role is reversed.

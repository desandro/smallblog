Freakangels is free weekly webcomic about a group of super-human youngsters trying to make things right in a post-apocalyptic London, written by Warren Ellis and art by Paul Duffield. I've been following the comic since issue #1 way back in 2008. The series ended last week. All of it is readily available online for your consumption.

I'm a sucker for post-big-'splosion storylines, so I enjoyed all the challenges the characters had to face, even with their super powers. Duffield's visuals are spectacular. He creates a war-torn London [plastered with rich textures](http://www.freakangels.com/?p=98&page=2). The architectural and background art in Freakangels is worth the price of reading just by itself.

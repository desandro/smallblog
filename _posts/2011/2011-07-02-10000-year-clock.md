> We are building a 10,000 Year Clock. It's a special clock, designed to be a symbol, an icon for long-term thinking. It's of monumental scale inside a mountain in West Texas. The father of the Clock is Danny Hillis. He's been thinking about and working on the Clock since 1989. He wanted to build a Clock that ticks once a year, where the century hand advances once every 100 years, and the cuckoo comes out on the millennium.

I am infatuated with this clock. I love the idea of something that exists outside our time, like the pyramids.

I think of epic quests like in video games, when a small band of misfits and heroes need to trek across rugged terrain to an ancient place. Inside this place is a cavern of incredible machinery. That's what this clock is.

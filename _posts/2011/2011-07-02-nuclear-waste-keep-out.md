> Few architects have to design anything to last more than 100 years, so how do you build a nuclear waste facility to last for millennia? And what sign do you put on the door?

The documentary mentioned in the article, [Into Eternity](http://www.intoeternitythemovie.com/), is watchable online (perhaps not exactly legally): [Into Eternity 1 of 6 (What Happens to Nuclear Waste?)](http://dotsub.com/view/8e40ebda-5966-4212-9b96-6abbce3c6577).

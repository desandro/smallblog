First off, the dogs in this video are astronomically cute. Paranormally cute.

Second, are there really old British ladies that have vast manors like that? I thought that was a trope of old mystery novels.

Morphic resonance is a faxinatin' subject for me. I think most people would be spooked off by it. But Sheldrake's approach here is brilliant. Instead of reinforcing his argument with laboratory results or exotic qualitative reports, he relies on mundane occurrences. (I suppose these would be ethnographic data, but now my liberal arts degree is showing). Pets know when their masters are coming back home. This concept seems so familiar, it's no wonder it's never been investigated before.

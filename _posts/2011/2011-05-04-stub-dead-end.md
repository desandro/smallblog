title: A stub, a dead-end
category: text
layout: blog

While building out the template for this blog, it occurred to me: What if didn't add any outside links? What if the page was designed to be a stub, a dead-end, where you could not progress from?

Typically, we want to encourage the user to explore onward, to discover more content. But considering how I browse the web, with multiple constantly tabs open, perhaps it makes more sense to discourage the user from going any further.

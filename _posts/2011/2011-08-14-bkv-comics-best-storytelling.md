> Comics is the best form of storytelling ever created. I love film and TV, and it's an honor to get to be a working writer in Hollywood, but nothing is as satisfying as comics. It's still the only visual medium where you can have both the emotional heft of a great cable show and the unlimited spectacle of a summer blockbuster, combined in this totally immersive package that makes the reader an active collaborator instead of just a spectator. And because the overhead is relatively cheap and the collaboration is usually just between a small, consistent team, the end product can be a very pure, undiluted creative vision.

"Transcendentally wonderful" lecture by game developer [Brian Moriarty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Moriarty), oft referenced by Jonathan Blow. Moriarty created several intellectually stimulating games in the 1980's and 90's.  Blow has mentioned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_(video_game)">Trinity</a> being a key influence on Braid.

> Contemplating these dazzling jewels of wisdom and eloquence gives rise to an extraordinary feeling.
> 
> A potent, rare and precious emotion with the potential to completely upset your life.
> 
> An emotion powerful enough to make a man abandon his wife and children, forfeit career and reputation, lay down his possessions and follow his heart without questioning.
> 
> That sweet, sweet fusion of wonder and fear, irresistible attraction and soul-numbing dread known as awe.
> 
> Awe is the Grail of artistic achievement. No other human emotion possesses such raw transformative power, and none is more difficult to evoke.
> 
> Few and far between are the works of man that qualify as truly awesome.
> 
> ...
> 
> Now, please don't come away from this lecture thinking that the key to awesome game design is the installation of Easter eggs!
> 
> Ordinary games, with their contrived Easter eggs and cheat codes, are like the Battery of the Month club.
> 
> You have to trudge down to the back of the store to get what you really came for.
> 
> If super power is what people really want, why not just give it to them?
> 
> Is our imagination so impoverished that we have to resort to marketing gimmicks to keep players interested in our games?
> 
> Awesome things don't hold anything back.
> 
> Awesome things are rich and generous.
> 
> The treasure is _right_ there.
